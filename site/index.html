        <h1> Vincent Van Gogh </h1>


        <p>
          Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist artist. He was and is a very influential figure in the world of art and creation.

          Many of Van Gogh's paintings use vivid colors blended together to create seamless and flowing views of the artist's world. He was a self-taught artist and learned through copying manuals and tracing over works of art. All of his works of art hold deep emotional and expressive nature due to the nature of his life.

          Van Gogh suffered from schizophrenia as well as depression, making him commonly known as the tormented genius. After his love for a girl was rejected, he lived in solidarity. Although he craved affection of other humans, he never lived it for long. Midway through his life he fell through spiritual despair and found that giving everything up for the Church brought him nothing. After that, his mission was to bring consolation to other humans via his art. Disaster struck in his life after the peak of his career when he cut off his own left ear under extreme stress. He was then sent to a hospital and later an asylum due to being seen as extremely mentally disturbed. He produced many famous paintings in his 12 months spent in the asylum. Van Gogh's life came to a tragic end when he shot himself, and died two days after doing so. Although a genius and producing great artworks of the century, Van Gogh was deeply troubled. Many of his artworks convey deeper meaning that show his internal conflicts, which is what will be shown in this website.
