              Although many people enjoy Van Gogh's most popular work, The Starry Night, not many realize the value and meaning behind this painting.

              For the literal background of this painting, it was created during Van Gogh's stay at the Saint-Paul asylum in southern France. It is a reflection of what he observed from the windows of the countryside. We get a view of the countryside as well as the world through Van Gogh's eyes through one of the most tragic periods of his life. This piece of artwork gives us insight into what it was like for Van Gogh during his depressive and schizophrenic episodes.

              It could be wondered why the Starry Night is such a beautiful work of art. It's minimal use of colors seems to add to the minimalistic beauty of the painting. It is said that the cypress trees in the corner of the painting represent the even death and suicide of Van Gogh. The sky and background is mostly concentrated with black and blue colors, and the stars are presented as yellow. This bright yellow present in the sky could represent the hope or small spark of joy in what can be seen as a mostly tragic situation. While people have tried to find many meanings in this painting, Van Gogh severely contended against any religious or spiritual meaning found in his paintings. He viewed biblical context as a rape of nature. This has not stopped people from finding the stars as apostles and the castle as Jesus. Some found motifs of femninity and masculinity as well. At the end of the day, no one can truly know if this was a simple representation of nature in the eyes of Van Gogh, or something more.
