       <p>
         There is a common myth that this is the lasting painting of Van Gogh's life due to its foreboding nature, but that is just a myth.

         This painting has some juxtaposing nature. It conveys a deep sense of solitude and sadness, but it also represents the healthy nature of crops and the natural world around us. Van Gogh wanted to convey that even if health, there is sadness, and in sadness there may be health.
       </p>

       <p>
         Some particular things to notice is the turbulent nature of the painting, which is common for a lot of Van Gogh's works. The blue nature of the horizon contrasts with the yellow of the fields. This is similar yet different from Starry Night. Similar as in the concept of the contrasting colors yet the placement of the yellow is very different. His paintings are highlighting different parts of nature yet shre the motif of sadness and desolation. The way the three paths fade into the horizon with no clear beginning or end also symbolizes the uncertain nature of life. You can also see a murder of crows, but it is not clear whether they are going futher away or coming closer. This nature of the picture adds to the foreboding and unsettling nature.
