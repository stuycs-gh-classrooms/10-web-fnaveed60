         This is one of Van Gogh's lesser known paintings. He considered this a showpiece and created it during the time he was experimenting with drawing figures.

         This painting shows the harsh reality of country life. This is why the five figures, with only four having visible faces, have been given tired and thinned out faces. The details of boney hands also show the harsh reality of country life.

         Although the figures were not drawn perfectly and the colors used were quite dark, Van Gogh was quite proud of this painting. He found that it captured exactly what he wanted to show, even if it earned quite a lot of criticism at the time. Although the room is quite dark, the figured can be seen slightly more illuminated than the rest of the room. This creates the effect of the viewers being in the room with the figures and nearly being a part of their conversation. Although there are many mistakes present in the painting itself, it still evokes a sense of reality and presentness, which is why it is regarded as one of Van Gogh's most important works.
